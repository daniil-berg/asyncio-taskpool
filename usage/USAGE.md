# Using `asyncio-taskpool`

## Minimal example for `SimpleTaskPool`

The minimum required setup is a "worker" coroutine function that can do something asynchronously, and a main coroutine function that sets up the `SimpleTaskPool`, starts/stops the tasks as desired, and eventually awaits them all. 

The following demo code enables full log output first for additional clarity. It is complete and should work as is.

### Code

```python
import logging
import asyncio

from asyncio_taskpool import SimpleTaskPool

logging.getLogger().setLevel(logging.NOTSET)
logging.getLogger('asyncio_taskpool').addHandler(logging.StreamHandler())


async def work(n: int) -> None:
    """
    Pseudo-worker function. 
    Counts up to an integer with a second of sleep before each iteration.
    In a real-world use case, a worker function should probably have access 
    to some synchronisation primitive (such as a queue) or shared resource
    to distribute work between an arbitrary number of workers.
    """
    for i in range(n):
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        print("did", i)


async def main() -> None:
    pool = SimpleTaskPool(work, (5,))  # initializes the pool; no work is being done yet
    await pool.start(3)  # launches work tasks 0, 1, and 2
    await asyncio.sleep(1.5)  # lets the tasks work for a bit
    await pool.start()  # launches work task 3
    await asyncio.sleep(1.5)  # lets the tasks work for a bit
    pool.stop(2)  # cancels tasks 3 and 2
    pool.lock()  # required for the last line
    await pool.gather()  # awaits all tasks, then flushes the pool


if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Advanced example for `TaskPool`

This time, we want to start tasks from _different_ coroutine functions **and** with _different_ arguments. For this we need an instance of the more generalized `TaskPool` class.

As with the simple example, we need "worker" coroutine functions that can do something asynchronously, as well as a main coroutine function that sets up the pool, starts the tasks, and eventually awaits them.

The following demo code enables full log output first for additional clarity. It is complete and should work as is.

### Code

```python
import logging
import asyncio

from asyncio_taskpool import TaskPool

logging.getLogger().setLevel(logging.NOTSET)
logging.getLogger('asyncio_taskpool').addHandler(logging.StreamHandler())


async def work(start: int, stop: int, step: int = 1) -> None:
    """Pseudo-worker function counting through a range with a second of sleep in between each iteration."""
    for i in range(start, stop, step):
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        print("work with", i)


async def other_work(a: int, b: int) -> None:
    """Different pseudo-worker counting through a range with half a second of sleep in between each iteration."""
    for i in range(a, b):
        await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
        print("other_work with", i)


async def main() -> None:
    # Initialize a new task pool instance and limit its size to 3 tasks.
    pool = TaskPool(3)
    # Queue up two tasks (IDs 0 and 1) to run concurrently (with the same positional arguments).
    print("Called `apply`")
    await pool.apply(work, kwargs={'start': 100, 'stop': 200, 'step': 10}, num=2)
    # Let the tasks work for a bit.
    await asyncio.sleep(1.5)
    # Now, let us enqueue four more tasks (which will receive IDs 2, 3, 4, and 5), each created with different 
    # positional arguments by using `starmap`, but have **no more than two of those** run concurrently.
    # Since we set our pool size to 3, and already have two tasks working within the pool,
    # only the first one of these will start immediately (and receive ID 2).
    # The second one will start (with ID 3), only once there is room in the pool,
    # which -- in this example -- will be the case after ID 2 ends;
    # until then the `starmap` method call **will block**!
    # Once there is room in the pool again, the third and fourth will each start (with IDs 4 and 5)
    # **only** once there is room in the pool **and** no more than one of these last four tasks is running.
    args_list = [(0, 10), (10, 20), (20, 30), (30, 40)]
    print("Calling `starmap`...")
    await pool.starmap(other_work, args_list, group_size=2)
    print("`starmap` returned")
    # Now we lock the pool, so that we can safely await all our tasks.
    pool.lock()
    # Finally, we block, until all tasks have ended.
    print("Called `gather`")
    await pool.gather()
    print("Done.")


if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Output 
Additional comments for the output are provided with `<---` next to the output lines.

(Keep in mind that the logger and `print` asynchronously write to `stdout`.)
