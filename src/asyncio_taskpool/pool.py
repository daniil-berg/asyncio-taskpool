Definitions of the task pool classes.

The :class:`BaseTaskPool` is a parent class and not intended for direct use.
The :class:`TaskPool` and :class:`SimpleTaskPool` are subclasses intended for direct use.
While the former allows for heterogeneous collections of tasks that can be entirely unrelated to one another, the 
latter requires a preemptive decision about the function **and** its arguments upon initialization and only allows
to dynamically control the **number** of tasks running at any point in time.

    Simplified task pool class.

    A `SimpleTaskPool` instance can manage an arbitrary number of concurrent tasks,
    but they **must** come from a single coroutine function, called with the same arguments.

    The coroutine function and its arguments are defined upon initialization.

    As long as there is room in the pool, more tasks can be added. (By default, there is no pool size limit.)
    Each task started in the pool receives a unique ID, which can be used to cancel specific tasks at any moment.
    However, since all tasks come from the same function-arguments-combination, the specificity of the `cancel()` method
    is probably unnecessary. Instead, a simpler :meth:`stop` method is introduced.

    Adding tasks blocks **only if** the pool is full at that moment.
