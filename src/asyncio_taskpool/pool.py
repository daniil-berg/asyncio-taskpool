__doc__ = """
This module contains the definitions of the task pool classes.

A task pool is an object with a simple interface for aggregating and dynamically managing asynchronous tasks.
Generally speaking, a task is added to a pool by providing it with a coroutine function reference as well as the 
arguments for that function.

The `BaseTaskPool` class is a parent class and not intended for direct use.
The `TaskPool` and `SimpleTaskPool` are subclasses intended for direct use.
While the former allows for heterogeneous collections of tasks that can be entirely unrelated to one another, the 
latter requires a preemptive decision about the function **and** its arguments upon initialization and only allows
to dynamically control the **number** of tasks running at any point in time.

For further details about the classes check their respective docstrings.

        (assuming there is room in the pool), which consumes the next element from the arguments iterable. If the size
        of the pool never imposes a limit, this ensures that the number of tasks belonging to this group and running
        concurrently is always equal to `group_size` (except for when `arg_iter` is exhausted of course).

        This method sets up an internal arguments queue which is continuously filled while consuming the `arg_iter`.
        Because this method delegates the spawning of the tasks to two meta tasks (a producer and a consumer of the
        aforementioned queue), it **never blocks**. However, just because this method returns immediately, this does
        not mean that any task was started or that any number of tasks will start soon, as this is solely determined by
        the `pool_size` and the `group_size`.

        Args:
            func:
                The coroutine function to use for spawning the new tasks within the task pool.
            arg_iter:
                The iterable of arguments; each argument is to be passed into a `func` call when spawning a new task.
            group_size (optional):
                The maximum number new tasks spawned by this method to run concurrently. Defaults to 1.
            group_name (optional):
                Name of the task group to add the new tasks to. If provided, it must be a name that doesn't exist yet.
            end_callback (optional):
                A callback to execute after a task has ended.
                It is run with the task's ID as its only positional argument.
            cancel_callback (optional):
                A callback to execute after cancellation of a task.
                It is run with the task's ID as its only positional argument.

        Returns:
            The name of the task group that the newly spawned tasks will be added to.

        Raises:
            `PoolIsClosed` if the pool is closed.
            `NotCoroutine` if `func` is not a coroutine function.
            `PoolIsLocked` if the pool has been locked.
            `ValueError` if `group_size` is less than 1.
            `InvalidGroupName` if a group named `group_name` exists in the pool.

    As long as there is room in the pool, more tasks can be added. (By default, there is no pool size limit.)
