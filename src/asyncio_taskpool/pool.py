This module contains the definitions of the task pool classes.

A task pool is an object with a simple interface for aggregating and dynamically managing asynchronous tasks.
Generally speaking, a task is added to a pool by providing it with a coroutine function reference as well as the 
arguments for that function.

The `BaseTaskPool` class is a parent class and not intended for direct use.
The `TaskPool` and `SimpleTaskPool` are subclasses intended for direct use.
While the former allows for heterogeneous collections of tasks that can be entirely unrelated to one another, the 
latter requires a preemptive decision about the function **and** its arguments upon initialization and only allows
to dynamically control the **number** of tasks running at any point in time.

For further details about the classes check their respective docstrings.
